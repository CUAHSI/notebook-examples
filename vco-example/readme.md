## Retrieval of the Analysis of Record for Calibration (AORC) Forcing Data (version 1.1) via HydroShare THREDDS's Server

This example demonstrates how to collect and visualize the AORC (version 1.1) precipitation data from HydroShare's THREDDS server and calculate the basin averaged precipitation over the Logan River Watershed in Utah (Figure 1). 

>The Analysis of Record for Calibration (AORC) is a gridded record of near-surface weather conditions covering the continental United States and Alaska and their hydrologically contributing areas. It is defined on a latitude/longitude spatial grid with a mesh length of ~800 m (30 arc seconds), and a temporal resolution of one hour. Elements include hourly total precipitation, temperature, specific humidity, terrain-level pressure, downward longwave and shortwave radiation, and west-east and south-north wind components. It spans the period from 1979 at Continental U.S. (CONUS) locations / 1981 in Alaska, to the near-present (at all locations). This suite of eight variables is sufficient to drive most land-surface and hydrologic models and is used to force the calibration run of the National Water Model (NWM).
